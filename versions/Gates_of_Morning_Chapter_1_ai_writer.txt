The provided text is not the chapter itself, but rather a Wikisource page indicating the chapter's absence.  To rewrite it in a more engaging and modern tone is impossible without the actual chapter text.  However, I can offer an example of how to rewrite *a portion* of such a Wikisource page, assuming it contained a message similar to the one shown, into a more user-friendly format:

**Original (implied from provided text):**

"Treasure Island/Part I/Chapter I is not currently available on Wikisource.  If you followed a link from another website, please notify the webmaster of that site.  The text may have been deleted due to copyright infringement or violation of inclusion guidelines."

**Rewritten in a more engaging and modern tone:**

"Oops!  Looks like we're still working on getting Chapter 1 of Treasure Island online.  If you found a broken link, let the website you were on know so they can fix it.  Sometimes we have to remove texts due to copyright issues or other guidelines.  We'll get this chapter up as soon as we can!"

This revised version uses more conversational language, avoids jargon like "inclusion guidelines," and offers a more positive and helpful message to the user.  To rewrite the actual Chapter 1, please provide the text of the chapter.
